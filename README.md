xbee-ruby Ruby-API for XBee ZigBee-RF-Modules
=============================================

I developed this gem for my CoYoHo Home Automation System. So only a small part of the XBee-API is currently
implemented. Especially only Series-2 modules in API-mode 2 and a subset of the available frame types are
supported.

Supported frame types

0x10 TxRequest

0x8b TxResponse
0x90 RxResponse
